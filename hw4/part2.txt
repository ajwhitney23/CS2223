The BetterForward algorithm will solve for one variable at a time.  In the example provided, you can not solve for just one value at a time, making it unable to solve the equation, since there is either 1, or 3 co-efficients, none of the equations have 2 co-efficients.

---Still need to figure out how to fix this....
