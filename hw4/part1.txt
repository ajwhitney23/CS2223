The ForwardElimination algorithm on page 210 fails to provide a solution because it doesn't work for the case A[i][i]=0.
In performing the subtraction in the algorithm we can create 0's which will cause issues. 
(this is what happened for the better part of 4 hours working on part 3)

The BetterForwardElimination algorithm on page 211 remedies this by adding a pivot point so if row one fails, 
it will find another row to then start from and determine soltuions that way.
