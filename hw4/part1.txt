The ForwardElimination algorithm on page 210 fails to provide a solution because all of the co-effients for the first row of the equations is 1, which does not allow the alogorithm to move on from the first row, causing it to fail.

The BetterForwardElimination algorithm on page 211 remedies this by adding a pivot point so if row one fails, it will find another row to then start from and determine soltuions that way, not allowng the program to get stuck on one row.
